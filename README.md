# @4lch4/pblib

This project/repository serves as a library for interacting with the [PushBullet API][0].

## What's With The Name?

I originally called this module `@4lch4/PushBullet` but the more I thought about it, I didn't want any issues with using the PushBullet name for my library. As a result, I'll be calling it `@4lch4/pblib`, which is just short for `PushBullet Lib`.
